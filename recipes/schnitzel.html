    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is one of the most famous dishes in austria, my home country.
    THis recipe will serve 4 people and will take about 20 minutes to make.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 veal cutlets, 150 - 180 g each (alternatively, use pork or turkey)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Approx. 100 g coarse-ground flour</li>
            <li>Approx. 100 g breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper </li>
            <li>plant oil, a lot</li>
            <li>Slices of lemon, to garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the cutlets until they are 3 - 5 mm thick. 
                You can use a frying pan or a schnitzel hammer for that purpose. 
                Season them with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour and breadcrumbs into <strong>seperate</strong> flat plates, beat the eggs together on a further plate using a fork. </li>
            <li>Coat each schnitzel on both sides in flour, then draw through the beaten eggs, ensuring that no part of the schnitzel remains dry. 
                Lastly, coat in the breadcrumbs and carefully press down the crumbs using the reverse side of the fork.</li>
            <li>In a large, not too flat pan, put enough oil for the schnitzel to be able
                to <strong>swim freely.</strong> Only place the the schnitzel in the pan when the fat is so hot that it
                hisses and bubbles up if some breadcrumbs are introduced to it.
            </li>
            <li>Depending on the thickness and the type of the meat, fry for between 2 and 4 minutes until golden brown.
                Turn using a spatula (do not pierce the coating with a fork!). 
                <p><strong>Tip: </strong>Gently swinging round the pan so that no fat leaves the pan increases the fluffyness of the coating - some say at least.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>Remove the crispy schnitzel and place on kitchen paper to dry off. Arrange o the plate and garnish with slices of lemon before serving. Serve with parsley potatoes, rice or potato salad.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

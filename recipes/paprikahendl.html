    <h2>Description</h2>
    Another fantastic dish that will take some time to prepare (1-2 hours) and will serve 4 people.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large chicken or chicken legs and breasts</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>knob butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>300 ml chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>3 tbsp freshly chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 red peppers, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 large ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped or tomato paste</li>
        <li>250 ml coconut milk or soured cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub the chicken pieces with salt. Heat the oil and butter in a large heavy-bottomed pan and brown the chicken all over for a few minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan and set to one side.</li>
        <li>To the same pan, add the onions and garlic and sweat for about 5 minutes. Add the paprika and stir until combined - <strong>take care not to burn it.</strong></li>
        <li>Add the stock and stir. Return the chicken pieces to the pan, adding a bit more stock if the mixtures seems too dry. Add half of the parsley and bring to the boil. Add the red pepper strips, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and simmer gently for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>When the chicken is cooked, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the coconut milk (or sour cream) and the remaining parsley. Check the seasoning and serve with rice, dumplings or noodles.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
